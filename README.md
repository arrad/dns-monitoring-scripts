# Dns-Monitoring-Scripts

A collection of Simple shell scripts for DNS and DNSSEC monitoring. 

The script have been explained in the November 3rd Webinar 'DNS and
DNSSEC Monitoring â€“ Strategy and Tools' from Men & Mice. You can still

These tests can be build upon, please send a pull request if you have
additions/fixes. These scripts are simple for a reason, please keep
them simple.
